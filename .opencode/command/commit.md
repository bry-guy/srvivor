description: Commits agent local changes as conventional commits.

Identify the uncommitted changes you've made so far. Define logical, atomic commits. Try to ensure each commit keeps the codebase valid - passing tests and compile-able. Other agents may be making changes in the codebase at the same time - avoid picking files you haven't used yourself.
