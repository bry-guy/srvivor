## Features

- Markdown notes with backlinks
- Basic workspace layout with file explorer
- Ready for project documentation

## Notes

- This is a bare minimum setup.
- Add more notes as needed for architecture, features, etc.
- **Naming Convention**: Use semantically meaningful names with datetime leaders in ISO 8601 format for session notes (e.g., `20251023T120000_topic_description.md`). Non-timestamped files like `code_patterns.md` are long-lived reference documents.
