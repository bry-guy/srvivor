# Archived Thoughts Directory

## Overview
The `thoughts/` directory contained extensive documentation for project planning, research, architecture, and development workflows. This has been archived as the project matures and core functionality is implemented. The wiki now serves as the primary knowledge base.

## Directory Structure Summary

### THOUGHTS.md
- **Purpose**: Master index and usage guide for the thoughts directory structure
- **Content**: Explains organization by design/, architecture/, tickets/, research/, plans/, reviews/, archive/, meta/
- **Status**: Core organizational principles moved to wiki guidelines

### architecture/
- **template.md**: Template for creating architecture documentation
- **Purpose**: Provided standardized format for architectural docs
- **Status**: Templates integrated into wiki workflow

### archive/
- **plan-fix-and-validate-drafts.md**: Archived plan for draft validation feature
- **Purpose**: Historical implementation plan no longer relevant
- **Status**: Feature implemented, plan preserved for reference

### design/
- **design-scoring-points-available.md**: Detailed specification for points available calculation
- **design-scoring.md**: Core scoring system design document
- **Purpose**: Original design docs for scoring mechanics
- **Status**: Moved to `wiki/archived_docs.md` for consolidation

### meta/
- **architecture.md**: Guidelines for creating and maintaining architecture documentation
- **thoughts.md**: Meta-documentation about thoughts directory usage
- **workflow.md**: Development workflow documentation
- **Purpose**: Documentation about documentation practices
- **Status**: Best practices integrated into AGENTS.md and wiki guidelines

### plans/
- **feature_agent_setup.md**: Comprehensive plan for OpenCode agent system refactor
- **plan-drafts-finals-restructure.md**: Plan for restructuring drafts/finals data organization
- **plan-fix-points-available.md**: Plan for fixing points available calculation bugs
- **Purpose**: Detailed implementation plans with phases, success criteria, and testing
- **Status**: Plans either implemented or superseded by current architecture

### research/
- **2025-10-12_drafts_finals_restructure.md**: Research on data structure reorganization
- **2025-10-16_feature_agent_setup.md**: Research on agent system improvements
- **Purpose**: Analysis and findings from codebase investigation
- **Status**: Research insights incorporated into implementations

### reviews/
- **drafts-finals-restructure-review.md**: Post-implementation review of data restructure
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance and lessons learned from implementations
- **Status**: Review findings used to improve processes

### tickets/
- **feature_agent_setup.md**: Feature request for agent system improvements
- **feature_drafts_finals_restructure.md**: Feature request for data organization changes
- **spec-fix-and-validate-drafts.md**: Specification for draft validation fixes
- **Purpose**: Issue tracking and feature specifications
- **Status**: Features implemented, tickets resolved

## Archive Rationale
The thoughts directory contained valuable historical context but became maintenance overhead as the project evolved. Key insights have been preserved in:

- Implementation details in code comments
- Current architecture in AGENTS.md
- Historical context in wiki notes
- Design decisions documented in commit messages

## Migration Notes
- Active development now uses wiki for session notes and historical context
- Architecture decisions documented in AGENTS.md guidelines
- Implementation plans replaced by direct execution with todo tracking
- Research integrated into code and wiki knowledge base
