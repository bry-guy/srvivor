# 20251016T150000_update_agents_md_wiki_guidelines

## Summary
Updated AGENTS.md to add guidelines for agents to store memory in the wiki vault. This ensures knowledge persistence and sharing across sessions.

## Changes Made
- Added "Agent Memory and Wiki Usage" section to AGENTS.md
- Specified note naming convention with datetime leaders (e.g., 20250501T190000_create_wiki)
- Defined when to save notes: always on commit, optionally anytime
- Guidelines for updating vs. creating new notes
- Linking: grep for similar notes and add backlinks
- Reading: follow useful links, avoid full traversal

## Rationale
To improve agent collaboration and memory retention, agents now document their work in the Obsidian wiki. This provides historical context for future tasks.

## Examples
- Note names: `20251016T150000_update_agents_md_wiki_guidelines`
- Linking: After creation, grep wiki for "agents" or "wiki" and link relevant notes
